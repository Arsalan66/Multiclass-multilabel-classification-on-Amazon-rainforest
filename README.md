# Multilabel-classification-on-Amazon-rainforest
## Welcome ##
## Download data from link : https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/data, the relavent files are train-jpg.tar.7z (600 megabytes) train v2.csv.zip (159 kilobytes, provided in my repository)
## Unzip using 7z , so on your ubuntu run command "sudo apt-get install p7zip". 
## Uncompress using command "7za e myfiles.7z".
##Once done run codes on "visualize_and_load_dataset" to prepare images and corresponding labels in any size, perferable size is 32,32 so that your PC doesn't slow down.
##run codes on "train_model" to train your model (This is an imbalanced dataset problem so metrics will be fbeta instead of accuracy).
##finally make predictions using codes from "test_model" and passing in the sample image.
##Have a great day.
